    <h1>A story of why Mr Khan loves Miss Shah so much</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>An introduction</h2>

        <p>So on Tuesday I learnt in class how to use a coding language called HTML. This is mainly used for creating wesbites so my first thought was
            why don't I try create a website for you to explain how badly I am in love with you lol. Maybe if you're ever missing me too you can just read
            this so it's a little less hard when we're apart. It's just a basic website but I'll make it better as I learn more and more. I love you.
        </p>

    <h3>My first reason why I adore you more than anyone</h3>   
    
        <p>My dear Sana, from the first time I saw you walking out of school looking like a <i>yummy yummy snack</i> (look at me even using italics, I'm so cool), I knew from that day onwards
        you are someone I want to have in my life. Lowkey tearing up writing this right now but it's okay we wipe the tears and move on. I had a 
        gut feeling that you would be the most amazing girl I have ever met and after our first proper conversation that night at 1:30am you proved
        right. You really are one in a billion my dear girl. It felt so strange that even though we had never spoke before that night, it was so
        effortless the way we got on with each other. You are the best thing to happen to me since 14th September 2022.</p>

    <h3>Numero dos (I be billingual, trust)</h3>

        <p>One thing I won't ever understand is how you make me feel the way you do. I will never ever be able to repay you for all the things you've
        done for me, you stuck with me through every argument and fight and every one of my low moments you were the only person I could turn to
        every single time without fail. How I deserved someone as beautiful as you inside and out is beyond me. You brought back the little boy in me
        that would always smile and be happy. Don't even ask me how I have managed to be without you for this long so far. Not a single moment of my
        time is spent without thinking of you.
